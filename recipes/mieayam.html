    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mie Ayam, or Indonesian chicken noodles, is one of Indonesia’s most beloved street food dishes. You’ll find it
        steaming from street carts, food stalls, and warungs (small local eateries), served to hungry crowds at all
        times of day.</p>
    <p>What makes Mie Ayam so special is the balance of savory, sweet, and umami flavors combined with springy noodles
        (like chow mein noodles), seasoned chicken, garlic, and <strong>flavorful chicken oil made from the chicken skin
            which is the signature element to mie ayam.</strong></p>
    <p>Mie ayam can be very simple, like noodles with the seasoned diced chicken on top, or it’s topped with bok choy,
        fried shallots, scallions or chilis, and a splash of chili sauce or broth on the side. In Indonesia, there are
        many variations of mie ayam.</p>

    <h2>How to Cook Strong Mie Ayam</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><Strong>Prepare the Chicken Thighs</Strong><br>
            Remove the skin from the chicken thighs and set both the skin and thighs aside.</li>
        <li><Strong>Sear the Chicken and Render Fat to Make Chicken Oil (Minyak Ayam)</Strong><br>
            Heat a large pan over medium-high heat. Add the chicken skins first, then lay the chicken thighs flat in the
            pan. Let the chicken skin render its oil and begin to sear the meat. There should be lots of chicken oil
            that
            comes out.</li>
        <li><Strong>Mix the Soy Glaze</Strong><br>
            In a small bowl, combine soy sauce and brown sugar. Stir until dissolved and set aside.</li>
        <li><Strong>Dice the Cooked Chicken</Strong><br>
            Lower the heat. Once the chicken is mostly cooked through and golden, remove it from the pan. Dice the
            thighs
            and crispy skins using a metal spatula, kitchen scissors, or cutting board. Return the chopped pieces to the
            pan
            with the rendered chicken oil.</li>
        <li><Strong>Sauté Garlic and Ginger</Strong><br>
            Push the chicken to one side of the pan. In the open space, sauté the minced garlic in the chicken oil until
            golden and fragrant. Add the ginger slices and let them infuse the oil.</li>
        <li><Strong>Season and Glaze the Chicken</Strong><br>
            Mix everything in the pan together: chicken, garlic, and ginger. Season with salt, then pour in the soy
            sauce
            and brown sugar glaze. Toss until the chicken is glossy and well coated. Don’t overcook—just enough for
            everything to come together.</li>
        <li><Strong>Remove Chicken and Reserve Oil</Strong><br>
            Transfer the chicken mixture to a bowl, leaving the seasoned chicken oil in the pan for the noodles.</li>
        <li><Strong>Cook the Noodles</Strong><br>
            Boil water and cook the chow mein noodles according to package instructions (typically 3 minutes). Drain
            well
            using a spider ladle or colander, removing as much excess water as possible.</li>
        <li><Strong>Toss Noodles in Chicken Oil</Strong><br>
            Add the drained noodles to the reserved chicken oil. Toss well so the noodles are fully coated and infused
            with
            flavor.</li>
        <li><Strong>Fry the Shallots</Strong><br>
            In a small pan, heat neutral oil and fry the thinly sliced shallots until golden and crispy. Drain on paper
            towels and set aside.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Assemble The Dish</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Dish</strong>
            In serving bowls, add a bed of seasoned noodles. Top with a generous scoop of the glazed chicken, then
            garnish
            with crispy shallots. Add sliced scallions, Fresno chili, or greens for extra flavor and color.</li>
    </ol>
